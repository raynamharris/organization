# **Deliverable Submission**

Briefly:

To submit a completed deliverable, you add it to the top of the README of your github repository as a Pull Request, and request review of the Pull Request from your Program Officer. They will either approve the submission, or will ask questions in the Pull Request. Once the submission is approved, you can merge the Pull Request in, and your deliverable is complete.

Less Briefly:

The overall deliverable submission process is about compiling all the information for your deliverable in a time-stamped, change tracked document, so that NIH can easily refer to it over time. The document where all this information lives is the README of your github repository. New deliverable submissions are added to the top of the document such that as you read down, you look further and further back in time. 

Once your submission is approved, you can close the issue for that deliverable. We don’t just turn in deliverables by closing issues, because they are hard to track and don’t have very good change tracking. They also don’t have the ability for your PO to ‘approve’ them in any tangible sense. 

When you update your README, you must update it as a ‘pull request’, which is really similar to how suggested changes work in Microsoft Word and other similar software. In a shared Word document you might suggest a change, and your PO would approve or deny that change.

In Github, the equivalent is:



*   You make suggested changes to your README as a ‘pull request’
*   Your PO reviews and approves those changes
*   You ‘merge’ those changes, so they are officially part of your README

This makes your README serve as a time stamped, official record of when you submitted your deliverables and when your PO checked and approved them. This makes it an excellent point of reference for both sides of your contract. 


## Detailed Instructions

These instructions use the Coordination Center deliverables repo as an example. Please follow these steps in your own repo, that contains all of the Deliverables Issues for your group.

1. Go to your main Github repository page, this will be nih-cfde/&lt;your Program>
2. Click the pencil in the top right corner of the readme:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40613731/114109619-77ef1c80-988a-11eb-86c4-55912c38d41a.png)


3. Deliverables should be entered most recent first, so that the oldest deliverables are at the bottom of the page. So, under the header, add information about your deliverable:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40613731/114109739-bc7ab800-988a-11eb-969a-e787f65e7d4a.png)
   a. This information should always include:
        1. The date you are submitting it
        2. A link to the deliverable issue you are closing/submitting
        3. A description of what the deliverable is
        4. Links to the deliverable and any supporting information
        5. Anything else you want your Program Officer to know about it
4. When you have added all the information you want, scroll down to the bottom of the page. There will be a box titled Commit changes. **Be sure to choose ‘Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request’** If you choose ‘Commit directly to the master branch’ your PO will NOT be notified that your deliverable is ready, and will not be able to give you an official sign off.

    5. When you choose ‘Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request’, github will automatically choose a branch name. It made mine ‘Acharbonneau-patch-1’. You can change this name, or leave it with the default. It doesn’t matter.
5. Click the green `Propose changes` button
6. This will open a pull request. We have added a template that pre-fills some information in your pull request to prompt you:
    6. 

<p id="gdcalert4" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image4.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert5">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>


![alt_text](images/image4.png "image_tooltip")

7. There are 3 important things to do on this page. 
    7. First add the link to the deliverables issue that you are turning in (this is the same link you put in the README) on the “This closes issue:” line. Adding it here will automatically close that issue when the pull request is completed
    8. Second, fill in the &lt;insert contact at your DCC here> with whoever should be notified if your PO has questions/comments/concerns about this deliverable
    9. In the ‘Reviewers’ on the right side of the screen, choose your PO:
        6. Click the gear icon:
            1. 

<p id="gdcalert5" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image5.png). Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert6">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>

        7. In the dropdown box type either ‘hresat’ or ‘kinsingc’
            2.

10. Wait until you PO responds. You should get a notification when they do.

        8. 

<p id="gdcalert7" ><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>>  gd2md-html alert: inline image link here (to images/image7.png).

        9. At which point you can click the ‘merge pull request’ button to finalize adding your changes to the README
    12. If they ask for more information, then you respond as best you can. If you need to add more information, links, etc to the README, [use these instructions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/11m0rCxYag3e7gpQaS4WacjSffXlrIqwddWqoX68N7z4/edit#heading=h.ne7lz5dj0f5e).
