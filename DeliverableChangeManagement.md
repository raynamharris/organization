**Deliverable Change requests**
If you need to change the scope or timing of a deliverable:
 - Post a comment on the github issue for the deliverable that requires a change and include:
    - What the change is
    - Why it is needed
    - What downstream effects this might cause
    - Note any dependencies
    - Explicitly tag the NIH PO team @awards
    - Explicitly tag the main CFDE-CC project managers: @CCadmin
- Your NIH PO may have follow up questions, which they will post as a comment in that issue, or they may approve the change
- The CFDE-CC will update the integrated master schedule when/if changes are approved
